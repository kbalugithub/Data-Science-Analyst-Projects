# Data-Science-Analyst-Projects
About Me:
Iâ€™m a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student at GITAM University, passionate about uncovering insights from data using Python, Tableau, and machine learning. This repository features three key projects from my academic work and NIELIT Summer Internship, showcasing my ability to solve real-world problems through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Projects:-

1. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
Description: Developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with high precision.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SMOTE, PCA, Deep Learning (Autoencoders).

Highlights-
* Handled imbalanced data using SMOTE to improve model performance.
* Used PCA for dimensionality reduction, optimizing computation.
* Achieved 95%+ accuracy with an autoencoder-based anomaly detection approach.

Impact: Enhanced transaction security by minimizing false positives and detecting fraud effectively.
